This namespace holds all Dynamic Action functions in Oracle APEX, useful for Dynamic Action plug-in developers.

### Functions

#### (static) cancel()

For Dynamic Action plug-in developers, call this function to stop execution of the remaining actions in a dynamic action without indicating there was an error. Returning false from the JavaScript function indicates that there has been an error which stops execution of the remaining actions only if the Stop Execution On Error setting is true. This function is useful to stop execution of remaining actions regardless of the Stop Execution On Error setting and also when the action is asynchronous.

##### Example

The following example of a plug-in JavaScript function is asynchronous due to the setTimeout function. It will cancel the remaining actions based on the result of function `someCondition`.

```
var self = this;
setTimeout( function() {
    if ( someCondition() ) {
        apex.da.cancel(); // don't process any more actions
    } else {
        doSomething();
    }
    apex.da.resume( self.resumeCallback, false );
}, 800 );
```

#### (static) handleAjaxErrors(pjqXHR, pTextStatus, pErrorThrown, pResumeCallback)

For Dynamic Action plug-in developers that write plug-ins that perform Ajax calls, call this function when an Ajax error occurs. Doing so handles both displaying the error message appropriately, and also resuming execution of actions in a dynamic action. It is typically passed as a callback to the *error* option passed in the *pOptions* parameter of the [apex.server](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/apex/26.1/aexjs/apex.server.html) Ajax APIs.

##### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `pjqXHR` | object | The jqXHR object passed directly from the apex.server error callback. |
| `pTextStatus` | string | The text status of the error, passed directly from the apex.server error callback. |
| `pErrorThrown` | string | Text describing the actual error, passed directly from the apex.server error callback. |
| `pResumeCallback` | function | Reference to callback function available from the this.resumeCallback property, handles resuming execution of the dynamic action. |

##### Example

The following example shows a typical use case of handleAjaxErrors.

```
// When executing dynamic action JavaScript logic, you have access to the 'this' variable, which contains
// important dynamic action context information. The 'this' variable contains a property called 'resumeCallback',
// which is a callback function to handle resuming execution of the actions in a dynamic action.
var lResumeCallback = this.resumeCallback;

// Define a function that calls handleAjaxErrors
// Note: Pass the pjqXHR, pTextStatus and pErrorThrown straight down from the apex.server error callback
function _error( pjqXHR, pTextStatus, pErrorThrown ) {
    apex.da.handleAjaxErrors( pjqXHR, pTextStatus, pErrorThrown, lResumeCallback );
}

// In the plug-in's Ajax logic, pass the callback to the 'error' option
server.plugin ( lAction.ajaxIdentifier, {
    // pData options
}, {
    error           : _error
    // pOptions options
});
```

#### (static) resume(pCallback, pErrorOccurred)

For Dynamic Action plug-in developers that write plug-ins that perform Ajax calls, call this function to resume execution of the actions in a dynamic action. Execution of a dynamic action can be paused, if the action's *Wait for Result* attribute is checked. *Wait for Result* is a dynamic action plug-in standard attribute designed for use with Ajax-based dynamic actions. If a plug-in exposes this attribute, it will also need to resume execution by calling this function in the relevant place in the plug-in JavaScript code (otherwise your action will break execution of dynamic actions).

Note: You should call *resume* following successful execution of your plug-in logic. In the case where an error has occurred, you must instead call [apex.da.handleAjaxErrors](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/apex/26.1/aexjs/apex.da.html#.handleAjaxErrors) which will handle resuming execution for you.

##### Parameters:

| Name | Type | Description |
|----|----|----|
| `pCallback` | function | Reference to callback function available from the this.resumeCallback property, handles resuming execution of the dynamic action. |
| `pErrorOccurred` | boolean | Indicate to the framework whether an error has occurred. If an error has occurred and the action's *Stop Execution on Error* attribute is checked, execution of the dynamic action will be stopped. |

##### Example

Resume execution of the actions in a dynamic action, indicating that no error has occurred (for example from a "success" callback of an Ajax-based action).

Note: When executing dynamic action JavaScript logic, you have access to the 'this' variable, which contains important dynamic action context information. The 'this' variable contains a property called 'resumeCallback', which is a callback function to handle resuming execution of dynamic actions, and is what you need to pass for the *pCallback* parameter.

```
apex.da.resume( this.resumeCallback, false );
```
